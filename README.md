## üß† About The Project

This is a small-scale project demonstrating **Clean Architecture**, adhering to **SOLID principles**, and drawing inspiration from **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. It also incorporates the **CQRS pattern** with **MediatR** to showcase a *structured*, *testable*, and *maintainable* approach to modern software development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

###  üß∞ Prerequisites

This project requires the following tools installed on your machine:

    .NET 9 SDK

    PostgreSQL

###  ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/natasakasikovic/gym-manager-app-backend.git
   cd gym-manager-app-backend
   ```
   
2. Set up database credentials.
  Edit the appsettings.json file in the Presentation project:

   ```sh
   "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=HOST;Database=DATABASE;Username=USERNAME;Password=PASSWORD"
   }
      ```

3. Apply migrations and create the database

    ```sh
    dotnet ef database update --project Infrastructure --startup-project Presentation
    ```

4. Run the application

    ```sh
      dotnet run --project Presentation
    ```

## üß± Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_004/clean_architecture.png?imwidth=3840)

- **Domain**

  This layer contains entities and enums. Business logic is encapsulated within the entities themselves. It is entirely independent of any frameworks, which ensures maximum flexibility, maintainability, and reusability.

- **Application**

  Like the domain layer, this one is also independent of the UI and database. It communicates with the infrastructure through **interfaces**, making it easily testable and adaptable.
  It follows the **CQRS** pattern using **MediatR**, allowing separation of read and write logic, and simplifying the handling of **cross-cutting concerns**.
  Two important MediatR behaviors are implemented in this layer:
  
     - **Logging behavior** ‚Äì used to track and log request execution for better monitoring and debugging.
  
     - **Validation behavior** ‚Äì used to enforce validation rules before the handler logic is executed, based on **FluentValidation**.
  
  The IDateTime interface is introduced to **avoid direct dependency on system DateTime**, and also to allow easy mocking during unit testing, which significantly improves testability.

- **Infrastructure**

  This layer handles external concerns such as **persistence**, **identity**, and other integrations. It provides the concrete implementations for the interfaces defined in the application layer. If there is a need to switch to a different database or identity provider, only this layer needs to change, while **Domain** and **Application** layers remain untouched.

- **Presentation**

  This is the entry point of the application. It contains **API controllers**, **endpoints**, and **handles centralized error management** via *BaseApiController*. It interacts with the application layer to execute commands and queries, serving as the interface between the user and the core logic.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Authentication**
  - User registration and login functionality.
  - Secured with JWT tokens.
  
- **Training Management**
  - Create, update, fetch training sessions
  - Sign up for trainings
  
- **Training Type Management**
  - Create, update, fetch training types
